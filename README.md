# SimpleBookingApp

A simple booking app for a taxi company created with Flask(python)

For educational purpose only!

This is a very simple flask application. You will find a booking form to collect important information to book a taxi. It's not designed to be used by the end user. It's more for admin

If all information are valid, the application will add a new booking to a google spreadsheet... for this functionality, you need to add a credentials.json file and create a sheet with called 'Bookings' to your google spreadsheet.

Contact me in case you should have questions about the code!!!
